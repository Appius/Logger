Logger
======

Simple logger on ASP.NET MVC + WebAPI

Idea
----
You can track any errors on your site based on ASP.NET platform on the client side and on the server. In other words,
any errors that occur on your site, will be transferred to the server and logged into a database. After it, they can be analyzed and always be available from web interface or via WebAPI (get, post, put, delete).
<br />
You can connect an unlimited number of sites.
